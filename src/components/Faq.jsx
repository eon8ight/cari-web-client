    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is CARI?</h2>
    <p>
      The Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute is a collective association of researchers
      and designers dedicated to carrying on the important work of categorizing "consumer
      aesthetics" from the late midcentury, when work on the subject somewhat trailed off,
      through today. The cyclical relationship between a culture's collective attitudes and
      the visual qualities of the artifacts it generates is crucial to observe and consider
      both when attempting to create timely, meaningful artwork and when analyzing the social
      and economic events of the last half century. CARI is a nonprofit online institute with
      hundreds of members and contributors.

      <h2>What is a "consumer aesthetic"?</h2>
      <p>
        CARI defines a consumer aesthetic as a visual movement unified by overarching attitudes
        and themes that survived long enough or became popular enough to be appropriated by
        capital (a bar that is being lowered constantly as our cycles of cultural propagation
        accelerate). Aesthetics are grouped here roughly by the time of their peak ubiquity, but
        many of them have examples to be found well outside that range as each movement spread
        from avant-garde settings to vernacular use.
    </p>
      <h2>How does the system work?</h2>
      <p>
        The concept of related, named categories is simply our best idea for organizing the
        content we find. The CARI system is not universally applicable; many artifacts fit
        either zero or very many aesthetics. Nor do the categories have hard edges--the
        intent is to define groups of artifacts based on attitutes and methods rather than
        pure visual similarity. Some categories span a very broad movement in design; others
        represent a popular but very homogenous trend.
    </p>
      <h2>Are aesthetics like "cottagecore", "seapunk", etc. researched by CARI?</h2>
      <p>
        Our use of the term "aesthetic" as a unified visual movement with shared inspiration
        differs somewhat from the common online usage to mean a lifestyle or fashion trend.
        For the purposes of keeping our workload manageable, CARI mostly handles aesthetics that
        have broken into "mainstream" culture by way of corporate appropriation; however, we
        consider online aesthetic movements equally worth studying for the same reasons as
        consumer aesthetics in that they can reveal shared attitudes within a subculture.
    </p>
      <h2>How can I use the CARI archive?</h2>
      <p>
        The artifacts presented here are intended for research and reference. We do not
        encourage or condone unauthorized redistribution of these materials, most of which have
        been granted to us in good faith under that pretense. CARI should be used as a source of
        inspiration and mood, not a source of free assets or images. If you use images from our
        collection for educational, nonprofit use, please credit their original creators as we
        have. Artifacts repurposed from CARI for profit or without attribution are no longer
        protected by "fair use" and will be subject to copyright enforcement.
